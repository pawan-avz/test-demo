# Git

- Git is a distributed version control or source code management system
- Git is free software distributed under GNU license

# Version Control System (VCS)
it is a software that helps software developer to work together and maintain a complete history of their work
- Allow developers to work simultaneously
- prevent overwriting each other changes
- maintain a history of every version

# Type of version control system
- centralised version control system
- distributed / decentralised version control system

# Centralised version control system
it used a central server to store all file and folder and enable team collaborate. but the major drawback of CVCS is its single
point of failure. in that case if the central server goes down for an hour then during that time no one can collaborate with each other
if that server get corrupt or broken the you will lose the entire history of the project

# Distributed version control system we not only checkout latest snapshot of the directory but we take full mirror image of the repo
if the server goes down then the rep from any client can be copied back to the server



# Advantages of Git
1. free and open source
2. fast
3. implicit backup
4. security
5. no powerful hardware
6. branch


# Git vs GitHub

# Git Command

> git --version

> git config --list
> git config --global user.name
> git config --global user.email
> git config --global user.name "<name>"
> git config --global user.name "<email>"

> git init
> git status
> git add <file_name>
> git add .  // all files
> git rm --cache <file_name>
> git commit -m "<commit message>"

> git remote -v
> git remote add origin <GitHub _url>

> git push origin master


> git init -> git add -> git commit -> git push


> git branch <new_feature>




# Git branch

> git branch     // list of branch
> git branch <branch_name>
> git checkout <branch_name>
> git merge <branch_name>   // make sure to first checkout in the branch in which you want to merge
> git branch -d <branch_name>

> git clone <git_url>

Exercise
1. clone repository
2. create branch by your name
3. checkout in your branch
4. create your_name.text
5. add
6. commit
7. push your branch into github
